# Trackoon



<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3-brightgreen.svg?style=plastic">
	

Trackoon is hosting fake websites on **PHP Servers** and uses **Serveo** for tunneling. The website asks for Location Permission, if the user allows it we get:

* Longitude
* Latitude
* Accuracy
* Altitude - Not always available
* Direction - Only available if user is moving
* Speed - Only available if user is moving

Along with Location Information we also get **Device Information**:

* Operating System
* Platform
* Number of CPU Cores
* Amount of RAM - Approximate Results
* Screen Resolution
* GPU information
* Browser Name and Version
* Public IP Address

**This tool is a Proof of Concept and is for Educational Purposes Only, Trackoon shows what data a malicious website can gather about you and your devices and why you should not click on random links and allow critical permissions such as Location etc.**


**Other tools and services offer IP Geolocation which is not very accurate and does not give the exact location of the user. This tool does it! :D**

## Tested On :

* Kali Linux 2018.2
* Ubuntu 18.04
* Arch Linux based Distro
* Termux
* Kali Linux (WSL)
* Parrot OS
* Zorin OS
* Mac OS High Sierra

## Installation


 **WARNING!! Before installation CHECK to see if you have the Dependencies ALREADY INSTALLED! If you install the same Dependency again you may break it! (Mostly on MAC)**
 
 CHECK YOUR STUFF (MAC) :
